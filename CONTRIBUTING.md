Before you start
----------------

Before your contribution can be accepted by the project, you need to create and electronically sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).

1. Read the [Eclipse License Agreement (ECA)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php).
2. Use the [form](https://www.eclipse.org/contribute/cla) to complete and submit a ECA.
3. You can use the [validate](https://www.eclipse.org/contribute/cla) page to check if you have already signed up.

Please use the same email address for the Eclipse website and GitHub. We have a *ip-validation* check on GitHub confirming each pull-request is from someone who has agreed to contribute to the project.

Repository and Branches
-----------------------

The GeoGig repository is located on GitHub: [github.com/locationtech/geogig](https://github.com/locationtech/geogig)

We maintain two branches:

* dev - this is where live development happens, we ask that incoming pull requests be made against this branch
* master - this represents the latest stable release

Pull Requests
-------------

Participation is encouraged using the github fork and pull request workflow:

* Include test case demonstrating functionality
* Contributions are expected to pass all tests and not break the build
* Include proper license headers on your contributed files
